2. Describe the average importance ratings.
3. Compare the brand attribute ratings for Fage (Q24) versus Oikos (Q30) given by those who purchased a brand in the past month. Do these brands differ from one another on perceptions of (1) All natural, (2) Price, and (3) Taste? 
4. Segment customers by usage situations and propose possible strategies for each segment.
5. Explore demand for flavors among the current flavors of yogurt.
